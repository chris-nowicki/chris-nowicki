### Hi I'm Chris :wave:
I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

#### **CURRENTLY:**
Enrolled in a 24 week coding bootcamp with [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com).
  - Studying `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and 2 Stacks: `Python` & `MERN`
  - 👨‍🎓 Expected Graduation: End of October 2022 🙌

#### **LEARNING:**
Aside from my coding focus with *Coding Dojo* I am enjoying learning [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and practicing my newly learned skills at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [LeetCode](www.leetcode.com), and [FrontEnd Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io).

I'm obsessed with finding amazing Cheese Burgers 🍔 🤤 and becoming a Jedi Master.
