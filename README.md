#### **LEARNING:**
Aside from my coding focus with *Coding Dojo* I am enjoying learning [Bootstrap](https://www.getbootstrap.com), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and practicing my newly learned skills at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

I'm obsessed with finding amazing Cheese Burgers 🍔 🤤
