### Hi I'm Chris :wave:
I'm an aspiring Full-Stack Developer.

#### **CURRENTLY:**
[Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com) 👨‍🎓 graduate as of 12/2/2022  🙌
  - studied `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and 2 Stacks: `Python` & `MERN`

#### **LEARNING:**
Aside from my coding focus with *Coding Dojo* I am enjoying learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), and practicing my newly learned skills at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), and [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

I'm obsessed with finding amazing Cheese Burgers 🍔 🤤
